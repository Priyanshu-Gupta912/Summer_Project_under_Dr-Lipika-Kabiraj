The project focuses on investigating the spray characteristics of non-Newtonian
 fuels using a novel airblast pressure swirl atomizer. This type of atomizer aims to
 enhance fuel atomization by combining a pressure swirl mechanism with a pre
filmer airblast process. Non-Newtonian fuels, which exhibit complex rheological
 behaviors, present unique challenges in atomization processes. The goal is to
 design an atomizer that can effectively handle these challenges and produce
 optimal spray patterns.
